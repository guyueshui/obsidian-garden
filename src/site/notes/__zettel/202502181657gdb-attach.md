gdb [attach](../notes/cpp/gdb基础.md#1.1%20绑定进程)到正在运行的程序上进行调试，

```bash
gdb program <pid_of_program>

# examples
gdb firefox 1234
gdb -p 1234
gdb -p `pidof firefox` # combined with pidof
```

使用`pidof <pattern>`可以直接返回命令的pid，在只运行一个实例的情况下，很好用。

gdb调试[coredump](202307051438CPP调试-coredump.md)

```bash
gdb program <corefile>
```

From gdb manual,

       You can run "gdb" with no arguments or options; but the most usual way to start GDB is with one argument or two, specifying an executable program as the argument:

               gdb program

       You can also start with both an executable program and a core file specified:

               gdb program core

       You can, instead, specify a process ID as a second argument or use option "-p", if you want to debug a running process:

               gdb program 1234
               gdb -p 1234

       would attach GDB to process 1234.  With option -p you can omit the program filename.
